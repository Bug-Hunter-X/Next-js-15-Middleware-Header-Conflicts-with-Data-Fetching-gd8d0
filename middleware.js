In Next.js 15, an uncommon issue arises when using the `app` directory's data fetching mechanisms (like `fetch` within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`) in conjunction with middleware.  If your middleware modifies the request headers in a way that conflicts with how data fetching functions interpret headers, you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors. For example, if middleware removes or alters crucial `Cookie` headers, your data fetching could fail due to insufficient authorization. Similarly, altering `Accept` headers could lead to data fetching functions receiving incorrect responses.  This is subtle because the middleware's effect is invisible at the level of the data fetching functions themselves; the problem manifests only in the final data that's fetched.
