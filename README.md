# Next.js 15 Middleware Header Conflict with Data Fetching
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 where middleware manipulation of request headers interferes with data fetching within the `app` directory.  The middleware alters the `Cookie` header, preventing proper authentication in `getServerSideProps`. 

## Bug Description
Middleware modifies the request, removing necessary headers (`Cookie`, for instance) for API requests used in `getServerSideProps` or similar functions.  This leads to authentication failures or unexpected behavior during data fetching. The issue only surfaces during the data fetching phase. 

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the errors in the browser's console or the server logs. 

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining your middleware and ensuring it doesn't remove or unintentionally alter headers required by your data fetching methods.  If modifications are necessary, ensure they preserve headers vital for API authentication and data retrieval.  Proper logging and careful review of API requests (using browser developer tools' Network tab) can greatly help pinpoint the exact nature of the header conflicts.
